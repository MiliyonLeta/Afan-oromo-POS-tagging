# Afan-oromo-POS-tagging

The ultimate aim of this work was to develop part of speech tagger model for Afan Oromo. Hence; the same word can have different grammatical categories in different sentences, the problem is how to find out which particular grammatical category is appropriate for a word in a given sentence.  To solve this problem, we prepared three different datasets: training dataset, test dataset and dataset for evaluation (manually labeled test dataset by linguistic). Similarly, Hidden Markov Model(HMM) was used to compute unigram (to compute lexical probability of word to be under a given part of speech) and trigram(to compute transitional probability of a given part of speech can be followed or preceded by which part of tag) of training dataset. To find the tag value for each and every word in test dataset, we pass list of tag in our training dataset, lexical probabilities, transitional probabilities and test dataset to Viterbi algorithm as parameters.   Then, we saved the test dataset tagged by our model and it was compared with dataset we prepared for evaluation. Finally, the accuracy of the model has been measured and the model shows 81.82% accuracy.
